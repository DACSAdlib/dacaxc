<h1>Adlib Archive Catalogue &ndash; Identity statement (tab) &ndash; Title
(field)</h1>
<p class="content">Requirement: Mandatory</p>
<h2>Catalogue according to the principles of, and
follow the general guidelines within:</h2>

<p class="content">&bull; International Standard Archival
Description, 2nd ed. 2011 (ISAD (G)): <a href="isadtitle.html">3.1.2. Title</a></p>

<h2>Where the above lacks specificity, and for
advice on recording metadata refer to:</h2>

<p class="content"><em>&bull; Describing Archives: A Content
Standard, 2013 - (DACS): <a href="https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/03_title.html#purpose-and-scope">2.3 Title</a></p>
<h2>Titles - Cataloguing post-DACS - Things to consider:</h2>
<p class="content">&bull; The inclusion of dates in titles is not mandatory</p>
<p class="content">&bull; Where the decision is made to include dates in a title, terms of estimation will no longer be abbreviated</p>
<p class="content">&bull; DACS refers only to 'formal titles' and 'devised titles' and does not make the further distinction of 'supplied titles'.</p>
<p class="content">&bull; DACS refers to the 'Companion Standards' for advice concerning formal titles, which it states are 'most commonly found on files or items'</p>
<p class="content">&bull; Following from this, DACS does not provide examples of item level devised titles. Consequently, cataloguers should refer to companion standards,for example: DCRM (G) when devising titles for Graphic Materials</p>
<p class="content">&bull; As a further consequence of the above, procedures ‘Guidelines for entering free text dates and date ranges’ and 'Cataloguing new manuscript collections’ and '‘Adlib - Guidelines for processing pictures collections’ will have to be amended or withdrawn from use</p>
