<h2>Formal title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A title which appears prominently on or in the archival material being described.</em></p>

<h1>DACS Definitions</h1>
<h2>Devised title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A devised title is one provided by the archivist when there is no formal title for the materials being described or when the formal title is misleading or inadequate.</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>The rules for recording a devised title differ from the rules for recording a formal title. Archivists usually devise titles for archival materials</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>Devised titles generally have two parts:</em></p>
<p class="contentindent3">&bull; name of the creator(s) or collector(s)</p>
<p class="contentindent3">&bull; nature of the materials being described</p>

<h2>Formal title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A formal title is one that appears prominently on or in the materials being described and is most commonly found in material that has been published or distributed, such as a title on a book, report, map, or film.</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>Formal titles can also be found on unpublished material that bears a meaningful name consciously given by the creator of the material, (e.g., a caption on a photograph, label on a folder, or leader on a film).</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>In the absence of a meaningful formal title, a title must be devised.</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>The archivist must use professional judgment to determine when it is appropriate to devise a title rather than transcribe a label on a container that may be misleading. When they occur at all in archival materials, formal titles are most commonly found on files or items.</em></p>
