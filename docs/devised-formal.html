<h1>ISAD Definitions</h1>
<h2>Formal title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A title which appears prominently on or in the archival material being described.</em></p>
<h2>Supplied title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A title supplied by the archivist for a unit of description which has no formal title. Title. A word, phrase, character, or group of characters that names a unit of description.</em></p>

<h1>RAD2 Definitions (Provided for context)</h1>
<h2>Supplied title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A Title provided for the Unit bening described that has no Formal Title. It may be taken from the archival material, from an external source, or it may be composed by the archivist</em></p>
<h2>Formal title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>The Title that appears prominently in or on the Chief Source of Information</em></p>

<h1>DACS Definitions</h1>
<h2>Devised title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A devised title is one provided by the archivist when there is no formal title for the materials being described or when the formal title is misleading or inadequate.</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>The rules for recording a devised title differ from the rules for recording a formal title. Archivists usually devise titles for archival materials</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>Devised titles generally have two parts:</em></p>
<p class="contentindent3">&bull; name of the creator(s) or collector(s)</p>
<p class="contentindent3">&bull; nature of the materials being described</p>

<h2>Formal title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A formal title is one that appears prominently on or in the materials being described and is most commonly found in material that has been published or distributed, such as a title on a book, report, map, or film.</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>Formal titles can also be found on unpublished material that bears a meaningful name consciously given by the creator of the material, (e.g., a caption on a photograph, label on a folder, or leader on a film). In the absence of a meaningful formal title, a title must be devised. The archivist must use professional judgment to determine when it is appropriate to devise a title rather than transcribe a label on a container that may be misleading. When they occur at all in archival materials, formal titles are most commonly found on files or items.</em></p>

<h2>DACS Statement concerning change in terminology</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>RDA rules for titles provided by archivists (“devised titles”) were in closer agreement with archival practices. DACS 2004 had used the term supplied for these titles, in alignment with ISAD(G). Recognizing the growing convergence between library, museum, and archival descriptive standards, and the predominant use of the term devised by companion archival standards to DACS, as well as the greater clarity of the term, the subcommittee has chosen to change the term supplied to devised. Finally, the subcommittee considers it important that the U.S. archival community
continue to monitor the development of RDA. Its reliance on entities and their linkages provides promise for informing the developing archival conceptual model and for greater cooperation between archives and libraries in the future.</em></p>
